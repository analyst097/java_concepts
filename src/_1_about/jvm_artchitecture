JVM Architecture

    1. Classloader

    - it is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files
    - when we run a java program it is loaded first by the classloader
    - 3 built in class loaders in Java

        1. Bootstrap classloader
            - first classloader which is the super class of Extension classloader.
            - it loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java SE like java.lang package classes,
                java.net package classes, java.util, java.io, java.sql package classes.

        2. Extension classloader
            - this is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader.
                It loads the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory

        3. System/Application classloader
            - this is the child class loader of Extension classloader.
            - it loads the classfiles from classpath.
            - by default classpath is set to current directory
            - can change the classpath using -cp or -classpath switch.
